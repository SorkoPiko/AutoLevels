# Auto Levels

Some levels have been misrated as different difficulties instead of Auto. This mod changes the difficulty icon to an Auto face so you know when you find one.

**Note**: Some of these levels require LDM. If it isn't auto, try turning it on.

## Features
- Changes the difficulty face of misrated levels to Auto.
